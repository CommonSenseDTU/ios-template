# Template iOS Application

This template serves as a starting point for building your own iOS application. In time it is intended to be used in applications which are automatically generated by the [Researcher-UI](https://github.com/CommonSenseDTU/researcher-ui).

## Getting started

In order to use this project you need to have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) installed.

When using the template application as a basis for new projects using the Common Sense platform and Musli client framework, it is recommended that you also check out [Musli](https://github.com/CommonSenseDTU/Musli) and [Granola](https://github.com/CommonSenseDTU/Granola) as sibling folders next to the template checkout.

Run `pod install` in the project folder to install all dependencies.

See the container project [README](https://github.com/CommonSenseDTU/container/blob/master/README.md) for information on how to get the backend up and running locally.

You should now be ready to get started building your very first Common Sense mobile client application.
